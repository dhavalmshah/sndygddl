Chapter 1 

Socioeconomic Indicators 

The LexisNexis® Socioeconomic Health Attributes and the LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Scores can 
help health care organizations assess risk. 


The LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Attributes are designed to assist health care organizations 
with their risk analytics and predictive modeling activities by equipping them with insights into 
environmental, financial, and other personal factors that influence an individual’s behavior and affect 
the individual's health outcomes. These insights provide health care organizations with the ability to 
identify and understand hidden patterns of risk and costs that cannot be uncovered with traditional 
health care data (for example, medical and pharmacy claims, lab results, and HRA). The result is that 
Socioeconomic Health Attributes can help health care organizations augment their existing 
predictive 
models to improve the accuracy of risk assessment of their members or patients. The attributes can also 
help create new models with enhanced data that can complement the health care organization's current 
predictive models. 


The LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Score: Total Cost Risk Score 3.0 is designed to predict an 
individual’s health risk, based on cost, over the next 12 months using socioeconomic data. The 
Socioeconomic Health Score: Total Cost Risk Score 3.0 can assist health care organizations in assessing 
and stratifying risk in their member or patient 
populations and proactively engaging those individuals 
to manage their health outcomes. The score is an individual-level score and is represented as three 
different 
calculations: Socioeconomic Index, Socioeconomic Rank and Socioeconomic Category. 


The LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Score: Readmission Risk Score is designed to use socioeconomic 
data to predict the risk of readmission within 30 days of an inpatient hospital stay. The LexisNexis 
Socioeconomic Health Score: Readmission Risk Score can help health care organizations assess and 
stratify risk in their member or patient 
populations. The health care organization can proactively engage 
those individuals to prevent readmissions and improve health outcomes. The score is an individual-level 
score, and it is represented as two different 
calculations: Readmission Probability and Readmission 
Category. 


The LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Score: Medication Adherence Score is designed to predict an 
individual’s medication adherence rate within the next 12 months using socioeconomic data. The 
Socioeconomic Health Score: Medication Adherence Score can help health care organizations, such as 
Pharmacies, Pharmacy Benefit Managers, and Life Sciences organizations, in assessing and stratifying risk 
of medication non-adherence in their patient or member populations. The health care organization can 
proactively engage those individuals to encourage adherence to prescription 
medication regimens and 
improve health outcomes. The score is an individual-level score, and it is represented as two different 
calculations: 
Medication Adherence Rate and Medication Adherence Category. 


The LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Score: Motivation Score is designed to predict an individual’s 
motivation level to care for one’s own health over the next 12 months using socioeconomic data. 
Motivation is defined as an individual’s willingness to manage his/her own health by avoiding acute costs 


BIS134-EN_US — 27 September 2021 Socioeconomic Indicators Function Web Service Interface Guide

 Page 5 


CONFIDENTIAL 

where possible, following care recommendations, including preventative guidelines, taking medication 
as prescribed, and being proactive regarding health issues. The Socioeconomic Health Score: Motivation 
Score can assist healthcare organizations, such as health plans, pharmacies, Pharmacy Benefit Managers, 
Life Sciences organizations, and health care providers in assessing the motivation of their members 
or patients to care for their own health. The Motivation Score provides actionable insight into the 
members/patients who are highly motivated and likely to actively follow care recommendations and 
respond to member/patient outreach initiatives. This information can also allow these organizations to 
proactively engage and encourage lesser-motivated individuals to better manage their own health and 
improve health outcomes. The score is an individual-level score and is represented as two different 
calculations: 
Motivation Level and Motivation Category. 


LexisNexis Socioeconomic Care Drivers are combinations of Socioeconomic Health Attributes that 
indicate potential socioeconomic health barriers for a member or patient. Care Drivers are designed 
to help health care organizations address social determinants of health barriers to improve health 
outcomes for their member or patient 
populations. 


LexisNexis Socioeconomic Health Solutions leverages the industry’s largest collection of public record 
and other proprietary sources, providing health care organizations with a powerful view of the social 
determinants of an individual’s health risk.

Programming Specifications 

LexisNexis® Risk Solutions provides web service communication 
information and programming notes to 
assist in your implementation. 


Communication 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions can help you establish communications with web services through the use of 
various formats, tools, and interfaces. 


SOAP 

You can communicate with LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services using the SOAP (Simple Object Access 
Protocol) messaging standard. 


There are many third-party tools and libraries that are available to simplify your SOAP client 
development process. LexisNexis Risk Solutions can provide a WSDL (Web Services Description 
Language) document that describes the web service and its messaging formats. Many SOAP tools can 
use a WSDL document to generate source code, to set the message parameters, and to call into the 
service. 


WSDL and XSD 

Develop your SOAP client applications using a WSDL or an XSD (XML Schema Definition). 


A WSDL provides a structured description of a web service interface. 


An XSD provides a structured description of a web service’s data elements, structures, attributes, and the 
relationship between them. Many of the available libraries that enable applications to use the SOAP also 
provide tools that use an XSD. 


Many of the available libraries that enable applications to use SOAP also provide tools to automatically 
generate a service-specific API (application programming interface) from a WSDL document. 


The WSDL and XSD descriptions for Socioeconomic Indicator web service functions are available using a 
URL from the following list: 


BIS134-EN_US — 27 September 2021 Socioeconomic Indicators Function Web Service Interface Guide

The URL must contain the desired version number. This is shown in the examples as ver_=n.nn&. 
Use the actual version number in place of the n.nn. The WSDL and XSD version numbers are not 
the same as the Socioeconomic Indicators function version numbers. Contact the XML support 
team to get the appropriate WSDL and XSD version numbers. For contact information, see 
"Technical Support" on page 8.

The WSDL and XSD may contain functions that are not documented in this publication. You should not 
use them until you receive notice that they are available. 


The syntax and functionality of WSDL and XSD are beyond the scope of this publication. For more 
information, see "References" on page 141. 


You can also access the following site to test and interact with the functions: 
https:// 
healthcare.lexisnexisrisk.com. For more information about the test environment, see "Test Environment 
Tools" 
on page 20. 


REST Interface 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services support the standard REST (representational state transfer) 
interface. 


The REST architecture allows parameter passing using name and value pairs. LexisNexis Risk Solutions 
web services support two REST syntaxes: JSON (JavaScript object notation) and URI (Uniform Resource 
Identifier). 


The URI string is constructed from the base address, the function name followed by a question mark (?), 
and parameters in the form of name=value, separated by ampersands (&). 


Parameters use the qualified element name in dot notation (for example, SearchBy.SSN or 
SearchBy.Name.Last). 


Example 

The following example shows a REST request that uses a URI format.

CONFIDENTIAL 

Failover and DNS 

Your application must follow failover and DNS (domain name system) guidelines. 


The IP address that is associated with healthcare.lexisnexisrisk.com is subject to change without 
notice. In particular, the IP address can change if LexisNexis Risk Solutions 
finds that it is necessary to 
failover to an alternate site. This can occur if there is a problem or programmed maintenance. 


LexisNexis Risk Solutions maintains a standby, secondary data center that connects to a different internet 
carrier. For failover and emergency purposes, set your DNS cache for all methods to very low (<=2 
seconds). Set your TTL (time to live) to <=2. 


If you manually failover to the secondary site, then you should notify 
LexisNexis Risk Solutions Customer 
Support so that LexisNexis Risk Solutions does not make changes that could unknowingly affect your 
service. 


If there is a TCP connection establishment failure or transaction 
timeout, then you must perform the 
following steps: 


To help ensure the correct operation of your application, periodically perform a DNS 
lookup for 
healthcare.lexisnexisrisk.com . In particular, if your application is unable to 
connect to 
healthcare.lexisnexisrisk.com , the application should force a resolution of the 
healthcare.lexisnexisrisk.com IP address. 


In addition, make sure that your firewall allows outgoing TCP connections to port 443 to the following 
range of IP addresses: 


• 
209.243.50.0/255 
• 
69.84.186.0/255 


If your application follows these rules, then failover to an alternate site should be transparent. 


Security 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions 
adheres to security policies and practices that are designed to help ensure that 
your business, identity, and data are kept safe. 


For information about LexisNexis Risk Solutions security policies and practices as they apply to your 
privacy, security, and compliance, see the Your Peace of Mind is Our Priority 
tip sheet at http:// 
www.lexisnexis.com/privacy/LN_PSCO_Diff_Final.pdf.

CONFIDENTIAL 

IP Addresses 

You must provide all of your internet-facing IP addresses to LexisNexis Risk Solutions XML Production 
Support so that the addresses can be added to an allow list for your account. 


• 
Provide your account number to LexisNexis Risk Solutions XML 
Production Support. 
• 
If you access LexisNexis Risk Solutions test environments or production environments from an IP 
address that is not on the allow list, then the following error is returned: 401 Unauthorized. 
• 
Your LexisNexis Risk Solutions 
XML consultant cannot put an IP address on an allow list. 
• 
If your IP address is going to change, then contact LexisNexis Risk Solutions XML 
Production Support 
at least one week before the change occurs. 
For contact information, see "Technical Support" on page 8. 


TLS Protocol 

The TLS (transport layer security) protocol is designed to protect the security of web communications. To 
provide the highest level of security, LexisNexis Risk Solutions requires that you use TLS version 1.2. 


The following applications are compatible with the TLS 1.2 protocol: 


• 
OpenSSL version 1.01 or later 
• 
Java version 8 or later 
You can configure Java version 7 to use the TLS 1.2 protocol. 
• 
Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6 or later 
You can configure .NET Framework version 4.5 to use the TLS 1.2 protocol. 
• 
Apache version 2.2.23 
Authentication 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services support Basic HTTP authentication through HTTPS. SOAP Security 
(through SOAP security header) is also supported. 


Do not use both of these authentication methods in the same SOAP request. If your XML user name or 
password is incorrect or if your IP address is not on the allow list, then the following error is returned: 
401 Unauthorized. 


Send your account credentials (user name and password) in the header of your request using Basic HTTP 
authentication. 


Examples 

The following example shows a Basic HTTPS 
Authentication in the HTTPS Header.

This example applies if you are using XML. 


HEADER 

POST /WsHealthcare/SocicoeconomicIndicators?ver_=n.nn HTTP/1.1 
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 
Content-Length: 12345 
Authorization: Basic eG1saWQ6cGFzc3dvcmQ= 

Use the actual version number in place of the n.nn. 
The Content-Length is calculated by your application. 
In the line that contains “Authorization: Basic xmlid:password”, your ID and password must be Base64


encoded. Contact LexisNexis Risk Solutions XML Support if you need help with Base64-encoding. For 
contact information, see "Technical Support" on page 8. 


Examples 

These examples show C# .NET code to send credentials. 


using (WsHealthcare wsa = new WsHealthcare())

 { 
wsa.PreAuthenticate = true; 
wsa.UseDefaultCredentials = false; 
wsa.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("xmlid", "xmlpassword"); 
string testStringReturned = wsa.SocicoeconomicIndicators("Connection Test");

 } 

It is important to set the PreAuthenticate value to true when using .NET. 
In Visual Basic .NET, the PreAuthenticate line should be similar to the following example. 


Public Property PreAuthenticate As true 


Versioning 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services use version information to maintain backward compatibility in 
your applications. 


Versioning lets LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services continue development, add new features and 
functions, and add additional data to result sets without adversely affecting 
existing 
applications. 
Versioning requires support for the passing of version information in requests. 


You can continue to use an older version until you are ready to change an application to handle 
additional features that are available in a newer version. LexisNexis Risk Solutions recommends that you 
use the latest version of a function whenever possible. However, the only way to get values that are 


BIS134-EN_US — 27 September 2021 Socioeconomic Indicators Function Web Service Interface Guide

CONFIDENTIAL 

returned in deprecated elements is to use a version that is prior to the point where the element was 
removed or replaced. Deprecated elements are noted in each function’s 
documentation along with the 
number of the latest version that supports the function. 


To allow for conversion time, LexisNexis Risk Solutions provides support for the previous two versions. 


Version information is sent in one of the following ways: 


In the base URL: 

https://healthcare.lexisnexisrisk.com/SocioeconomicIndicators?ver_=n.nn 

In a tag in the SOAP header: 

SOAPAction: 
"WsHealthcare/SocioeconomicIndicators?ver_=n.nn" 

This information is used in most WSDL-generated, SOAP-based calls unless the information is overridden 
in the base URL. If you do not provide version information in the base URL, then the default version 
information is used. 



The URL must contain the desired version number. This is shown in the examples as ver_=n.nn&. 
Use the actual version number in place of the n.nn. The WSDL and XSD version numbers are not 
the same as the Socioeconomic Indicators function version numbers. Contact the XML support 
team to get the appropriate WSDL and XSD version numbers. For contact information, see 
"Technical Support" on page 8. 
Default Versions 

If you do not provide version information in the base URL, then the default version is used. The default 
versions differ depending on the method that you use to call a function. 


LexisNexis Risk Solutions recommends that you provide version parameters in the base URL.

If you use a development environment that generates stub or proxy classes from the WSDL, then your 
application should automatically use the version of the WSDL that you use to generate those stubs. 


To override this value, you must include version information in the base URL in your code. Updating 
a WSDL in your development environment should automatically update all the stubs to use the latest 
version. 


It is important to note that most WSDL code generators create methods for all fields that are defined in 
the WSDL. Therefore, you may see methods for deprecated fields. You should not use any methods that 
refer to deprecated fields.

HTML Forms 

HTML forms (either forms that you create or the forms on the LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services 
website) automatically use the latest version of a function. Any HTML page that uses a FORM tag with 
action= uses the latest version. 


Raw XML 

Applications that use raw XML processing (“do it yourself” socket applications) default to the earliest 
version of a function unless you send version information. 


Mix -and -Match Versions 

You may want to mix-and-match versions of LexisNexis Risk Solutions web service functions. If you 
mix-and-match versions of LexisNexis Risk Solutions web service functions, then you have the ability to 
modify your application at your own pace. 


For example, you might have a procedure in your application that is written to an earlier version and 
do not want to modify the version at this time, but you want to add another procedure that uses a 
newly-released function. You must add the earlier version information to the base URL for the existing 
function to ensure that the URL continues to function in the same way, and use a different base URL for 
each of the other functions. 


Credentials 

To prevent potential errors, you are issued two sets of user ID and password credentials. 


LexisNexis Risk Solutions issues one set of credentials for development and testing and a different set of 
credentials for production data. The credentials for production data are not issued until you contact your 
account representative and complete testing. 


EchoTest Function 

The EchoTest function uses an input string and echoes the value in its result. 


This function is intended for connectivity 
testing. A successful response indicates a good connection to 
the server that is hosting the LexisNexis Risk Solutions web service functions.

Testing 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions provides a test environment to help you develop and test the XML interface. 


Your account representative provides the web service URL and development credentials for the test 
environment. 


Test Environment Access 

Your account representative sends you a web service URL for the test environment and development 
credentials for the test environment. 


Access the test environment using the web service URL that you receive from your account 
representative. The LexisNexis Risk Solutions web service URL that you use for development is the 
same web service URL that you use for production. The credentials that you use for authentication 
determine whether you access the test environment or the production environment. Authenticate your 
access using your development credentials (see "Authentication" on page 15). Development credentials 
always contain the letters DEV in the user ID (for example, abcDEVxml). 


Test Environment Tools 

The LexisNexis Risk Solutions test environment toolbar provides options for testing.

Programming Notes 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions provides programming notes that you should consider as you create code to 
interact with LexisNexis Risk Solutions systems. 


General XML Guidelines 

LexisNexis Risk Solutions suggests that you follow general XML guidelines as you integrate with web 
services. 


The order of elements within a given hierarchy is subject to change and is not guaranteed. You should 
code to accommodate changes to the element order. 


Response elements may not be returned because there is no information available for the search 
subject. You should code to accommodate the presence and absence of response elements.

User Codes 

Every web service function supports the submission of the following user codes within the User 
structure: ReferenceCode, BillingCode, and QueryId. Each element has its own purpose and specific 
behavior to support that purpose. 


ReferenceCode 
is returned in your billing statement. This element lets you keep track of the project for 
which a query was submitted. For example, if you submit multiple queries on behalf of a client named 
Ajax Corporation, then you can submit that name as the ReferenceCode and easily identify those queries 
on your billing statement. ReferenceCode is not returned in your query results. 


BillingCode replaces your Login Name in the LexisNexis Risk Solutions billing detail logs. For example, if 
your login name is “ekdresearch,” then you can submit a “friendlier” name as your BillingCode, such as 
“Emily Kate,” so that queries are easier to identify. 
BillingCode should be used carefully, and end users 
should not provide this code directly. Instead, the code should be handled programmatically to prevent 
the possibility of misuse. 


You provide a QueryId, and LexisNexis Risk Solutions web services echoes the QueryId back in results. 
QueryId is returned only in the query results. QueryId is not available in a billing statement or log. Use 
this ID to include information such as a customer’s account number in the results. You might use this ID 
to distinguish between multiple responses that are returned from requests that you send for processing 
at the same time. 
QueryId provides additional 
capabilities that you can use in the post-processing of 
results. 


The EndUser structure contains information about the entity on whose behalf the query is submitted. 


User codes are inside the User structure in a request, as shown in the following example. 


<User> 


<!-- ReferenceCode is returned in your billing statement --> 
<!-- BillingCode replaces user’s login name in billing details --> 
<!-- QueryId is returned in results --> 

<ReferenceCode>Corporation name</ReferenceCode> 


<BillingCode>Account manager name</BillingCode> 


<QueryId>Corporation123</QueryId>

SocioeconomicIndicators Request Descriptions 

Request descriptions can help you code to web services. For best results, and to help the request 
detect other variables that can provide additional insights, you should provide all of the available input 
elements in a request. 


The following table lists the available input elements, the element requirements, and brief descriptions 
of the data. 


The Req? (Required) column contains one of the following possible values: 


• 
Y = Required to obtain results 
• 
N = Not required 
• 
N/A = Not applicable 
Do not use this element for input. Although these elements are currently not considered when 
processing a request, this situation could change at any time. Therefore, you should not use the 
elements in requests.
